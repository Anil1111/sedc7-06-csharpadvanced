# Exercise
### Refactoring and adding features to an existing code
We have an Academy application. This application has the following features: 
* Have users
* Users can log in
* Users have different roles ( Admin, Trainer, Student ) 
* Users can perform different actions depending on their role
* Admin can add and remove users
* Trainer can see all subjects and students 
* Student can enroll in a subject and see their grades

#### Your job is to fix the following bugs:
* Print grades does not print the name of the subject
* Login requires two entries for password
* Trainer option for subjects prints students instead of subjects 
* A person can enter any number when choosing role on the first menu instead of only 1 2 or 3

#### And add the following features:
* Add another option for the admin to choose that prints all users and their role ( ex. Bob Bobski - Trainer) 
* Add another option for the student to choose that prints it's average grade
