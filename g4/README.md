# Advanced C# Development
Welcome to the Advanced C# Development course. This course will be a course built on top of our previous course C# Basic. This means that we will be learning new and advanced features of the C# language by using all the things that we learned in the previous subject. This subject will have 15 modules and we will dive deep in to C# and what it can do.
