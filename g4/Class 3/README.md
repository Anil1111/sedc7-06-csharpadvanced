# Exercise
Create a Dog class that has:
* Name
* Age
* Race
* Color
* Chip
* AddChip( method ) - accepts all nececery information and adds chip to this dog
* IdentifyDog( static method ) - accepts a dog object and shows info about the dog on screen if the dog has chip, otherwise  it tells the user that the dog is an unknown dog. 

Create a nested class called Chip with:
* Id
* Owner
* Address
* Constructor - sets owner and address, generates a random number as I'd from 1000 to 9999

** Hint **:  Use the Internet if you are stuck at any RANDOM problem ;-) 

** Bonus **:  Make a static class called shelter with: 
* Dogs  - queue
* Adopt( method) - accepts owner and address, adds chip to the next dog for adoption and takes it out of the Dogs queue. Show a success message.
